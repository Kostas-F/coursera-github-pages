This is a temporary website I created to fit the needs of a Coursera course and familiarize myself a bit with jekyll, github pages, github actions etc. It is supposed to have some content so there may be some stuff I find interesting around (or a bunch of lorem ipsum)
This is the base Jekyll theme, Minima. I might try some others if I feel like it.

Stuff used around these pages :

Minima:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

Jekyll:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)


[jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll
