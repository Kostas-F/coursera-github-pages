This is the first of a few sample/placeholder posts in this static site. In order to fill it with something other than lorem-ipsum text I would like to briefly talk about a topic that interests me in each post. In this one I would like to talk about computers (starting off with a narrow scope is very important in blogging)

# Modern ≠ Good and Newer ≠ Better. At least not always

In the past I had become myopic, due to my constant tinkering and nerding out about computers, toward most people's technical knowhow. It may also be hard to believe for you, but most people don't know what an SSD is or how much RAM is too little. They most certainly don't know if an atom or a celeron are better or worse than an i3, a ryzen 5 (from the first zen gen) or a pentium. These things that I took for granted that most other people took into account when buying computers. So I thought that everyone basically had similar or better experience using their computers than I had, since my budget has never left the budget category.

When I first found out how unusable most people's laptops are I almost got depressed. Friends had new laptops, shiny and glossy with celerons and 4gb of RAM on windows 10. Others had older laptops full of dust blocking the fans and crusty thermal paste. More than a few just thought having to stop using a computer because the CPU got so hot it throttled back to 1975 was _normal_. 
All payed too much and got too little out of their computers. No matter the type (laptop,desktop, tablet or smartphone) all the people around me had subpar computing experiences while living in situations better than 90% of the world's population. The only problem was that they did not have or want to spent obcene ammounts of money for their gear.

At this point, I have helped almost all my friends and family buy computers. All thinkpads,around the 40 - 70 generation (meaning 5th gen to 7th gen intel) to take advantage of compatible parts. Some I pushed to try some windows-like version of linux, others I debloated windows 10 a bit. Everyone has a better experience than before even though some got a 3-4 year older laptop than what they had. 

Why is it even an option to buy an unusable, unservicable and borderline unupgradable laptop? Who is it for?

I tried to see what the limit was and while looking I found out about coreboot. Nothing to do with getting more performance out of a computer but also really cool. A copmletely open source, modern computer that can reliably get you through your web browsing, pdf reading, email writing day. 

I bought a 50€ beat up thinkpad X200 with a top of the line core 2 duo (P8800 i think?) with a partially working keyboard. The only thing wrong was an iffy ribbon cable connection. Already with the 4Gb of ram on it xfce debian was usable. After a couple of months I stumbled upon and liberated a pair of 2rx8 4Gb sticks from a friends laptop I was repasting (don't worry I gave him an upgrade) and I bought a clip from aliexpress to hook up to a pi. After flashing libre boot (for that tasty blobless experience) I re-installed debian and I tried to use the laptop as my personal weekend laptop. And I realized it was fine. It was slower, hotter and sometimes it lagged when I had more than it could handle open but there was no reason I could not get by on it.

I don't have a very well put together point, a thesis statment. I just want to say that, if you are one of those people who enjoy tinkering and upgrading and cleaning computers, take a look around. For others your hobby is a chore and you can make their life just little more bearable by doing what you were already going to do in the evening, just on a new laptop. 

Make sure you attach an MIT licence though.
