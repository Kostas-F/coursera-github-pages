This is the first of a few sample/placeholder posts in this static site. In order to fill it with something other than lorem-ipsum text I would like to briefly talk about a topic that interests me in each post. In this one I would like to talk about computers (starting off with a narrow scope is paramount)

What I really want to talk briefly about is how myopic I had become due to my constant tinkering and nerding out about computers. It may be hard to believe but most people don't know what an SSD is or how much RAM is too little. They most certainly don't know if an atom or a celeron are better or worse than an i3, a ryzen 5 (from the first zen gen) or a pentium. These things that I knew I took for granted that most other people took into account when buying computers. 

When I first found out how unusable most people's laptops are I almost got depressed. Friends had new laptops, shiny and glossy with celerons and 4gb of RAM on windows 10. Others had older laptops full of dust blocking the fans and crusty thermal paste. Some just stopped using them when it got too hot and just used their phones. All payed too much and got too little out of their computers. 

At this point, I have helped almost all my friends and family buy computers. All thinkpads,around the 40 - 70 generation (meaning 5th gen to 7th gen intel) to take advantage of compatible parts. Some I pushed to try some windows-like version of linux, others I debloated windows 10 a bit. Everyone has a better experience than before even though some got a 3-4 year older laptop than what they had. 

Why is it even an option to buy an unusable, unservicable and borderline unupgradable laptop? Who is it for?
